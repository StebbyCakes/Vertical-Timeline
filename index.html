        <p>In software engineering, rubber duck debugging is a method of debugging code. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing
          themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.</p>

        <p>Using the rubber duck is a proven effective method for learning code. This is because our thoughts are generally much faster than our speach. Through speaking to a duck, an inanimate object that knows nothing about code, the user is forced to explain things slower and ideally more thoroughly than when just thinking to his or herself "why isn't my code working?".</p>

        <p>The duck has helped many aspring programmers to figure out their bugs. Some probably much more complex than anything I have experienced at Carolina Code School thus far, but nonethelesss my duck has helped me. I will now forever have a rubber duck on my desk for the general purpose of dubugging my code.</p>
